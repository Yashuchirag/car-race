# Progress

Live state of the project. Updated as work happens, not at the end, so that an
aborted session can be resumed instead of redone.

**Read section 1 first.** It says exactly where things stand and what the next
concrete action is. Everything below it is detail.

---

## 1. Resume here

**Last updated:** 2026-09-23 (the car now drives the generated circuits)

**Last completed:** The headless lap runner. The validated car drives every
circuit the pipeline generates, on track, in `--lap all`. Before this the two
halves of the project had never met.

**Next action:** Install Unity 6 LTS (manual, section 5). Then follow
`Unity/README.md`: copy both script folders in, build the skidpad scene it
describes, and drive it. Expect a few compile errors on first import where the
stub's signatures differ from the real engine, and fix the stub when you hit one.

**Nothing is half-finished.** Three checks pass on a clean run:

```bash
Tools/.venv/bin/python Tools/verify_all.py                     # expect: 6 of 6 circuits pass
dotnet run --project Sim/CarRace.Harness -c Release            # expect: All 5 checks pass
dotnet run --project Sim/CarRace.Harness -c Release -- --lap all  # expect: 6 of 6 on track
dotnet build Sim/CarRace.UnityCheck -c Release                 # expect: 0 Error(s)
```

The four WIP rows in section 3 are WIP because compiling is not running. Nothing
about them is unfinished code; what is missing is the editor.

If either fails on a fresh checkout, that is a regression and not something you
left unfinished.

## 2. Status key

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| DONE | Built and verified. A command in section 7 proves it. |
| WIP | Started. The row says exactly where it stopped and what comes next. |
| BLOCKED | Cannot proceed. The row says what is blocking it and who can clear it. |
| TODO | Not started. |

A row only becomes DONE when its verification command passes.

## 3. Work breakdown

### Phase 0, environment

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hardware audit and spec decisions | DONE | Section 3 of IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md |
| Python venv and dependencies | DONE | `Tools/.venv`, `Tools/requirements.txt` |
| .NET 8 SDK for headless physics | DONE | `dotnet --version` reports 8.0.131 |
| Git repository | DONE | Initialised 2026-09-22 |
| Off-machine backup | DONE | GitHub repo `Yashuchirag/car-race`, public, `main` tracking `origin/main` |
| Licensing | DONE | MIT for code, ODbL for `Tracks_Data/`. See README. |
| Unity 6 LTS installed | BLOCKED | Manual step, needs your account login. Section 5. |
| Unity project created at `D:\Dev\CarRace` | BLOCKED | Depends on the row above |
| Git LFS configured | TODO | Only needed once binary art assets exist |


### Phase 1, vehicle physics

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Config and tyre data model | DONE | `Sim/CarRace.Vehicle/CarConfig.cs`, `Tyre.cs` |
| Pacejka tyres, load sensitivity, friction ellipse, relaxation | DONE | `Tyre.cs`, `VehicleSim.cs` |
| Suspension, dampers, anti-roll bars, roll centres | DONE | `VehicleSim.cs` |
| Drivetrain: curve, launch clutch, gearbox, limited slip diff | DONE | `Drivetrain.cs` |
| Aero, Ackermann steering, ABS and traction control | DONE | `VehicleSim.cs` |
| Headless harness and rigid body | DONE | `Sim/CarRace.Harness/` |
| Closed-form expectations | DONE | `Analytic.cs` |
| Five validation checks | DONE | All pass. Section 7. |
| Telemetry CSV export | DONE | `--csv <path>` |
| Unity MonoBehaviour wrapper | WIP | `CarController.cs`. Written and type-checked, not run in the editor. Applies the wrench as `AddForce` plus `AddTorque`, which is equivalent to per-wheel `AddForceAtPosition` and cheaper. |
| `IGround` over `Physics.SphereCast` | WIP | `UnityGround.cs`. Written and type-checked, not run. Raycast fallback for a probe that starts already overlapping. |
| ScriptableObject returning a `CarConfig` | WIP | `CarDefinition.cs`. Every number mirrored as a serialized field; a new asset defaults to the validated reference car. |
| Cameras: chase, hood, cockpit | WIP | `CarCamera.cs`. Chase rig follows the velocity vector, not the car's facing, so a slide is visible. |
| Driver input, keyboard and gamepad | WIP | `DriverInput.cs`. Old input manager, so a car drives with no input asset authored. |
| Manual shifting in the model | DONE | `Drivetrain.Shift`. Setting `Gear` directly skipped the shift time, so a manual upshift was free lap time. |
| **Feel test on a gamepad** | BLOCKED | The real Phase 1 exit criterion. Needs Unity. Numbers passing is not the same as enjoyable. |

### Phase 2, track pipeline

**DONE.** Six circuits pass, all within 0.17% of published length. Detail in
`Tools/README.md`. Remaining polish is listed under section 6, not here, because
none of it blocks anything.

### Phase 3, AI and race systems

Brought forward out of order, because everything left in Phase 1 needs Unity and
this does not. It is also the first time the two halves of the project meet: the
physics has never driven a corner the track pipeline produced.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Track data into C# | DONE | `Sim/CarRace.Track/`, engine agnostic. JSON loading stays in the harness because Unity brings its own. |
| Speed plan from the car's own limits | DONE | Quasi-steady-state, both passes sharing one friction ellipse. The plan in the JSON is for a GT3, not this car. |
| Path-following driver | DONE | Curvature feedforward plus Stanley feedback at the front axle, PI on speed. Reused by Unity AI later. |
| Headless lap on a real circuit | DONE | `--lap all`, 6 of 6 on track. Section 7. |
| AI opponents, race state machine, flags, pit stops | TODO | The rest of Phase 3, untouched. |

### Phases 4 to 6

TODO, all of them. Specified in IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md sections 11 to 13.
Nothing started, nothing to resume.

## 5. Blocked on you

1. **Install Unity 6 LTS.** Set the Hub's editor install location to D:. This is
   the only thing gating Phase 1 completion and everything after it.
2. **Add a Windows Defender exclusion** for the project folder and the Unity
   processes once it exists. Typically 2 to 5x on import times on a spinning disk.
3. **Push after meaningful work.** `git push` now that `origin` is configured. The
   repo is private; making it public later is a one-line change, the reverse is
   not really possible.

---

## 6. Open issues and deferred decisions

Known, deliberate, and not blocking. Recorded so they are not rediscovered.

**Vehicle physics**

- Car is understeer-biased: front slip angles reach 13 to 20 degrees at the limit
  while the rear sits at 3 to 5. That is why skidpad lands 15% under the tyre
  ceiling. Tuning, not a defect. Soften `AntiRollFront` or stiffen `AntiRollRear`.
- 0 to 100 is 11.6% above the perfect-launch analytic floor. Tyre relaxation and
  traction control catching the wheel account for it. Real launches lose time too.
- Tyre temperature and wear are not modelled. Phase 6 if wanted at all.
- Force feedback for a wheel needs a native plugin. Real uncertainty, Phase 6.

- The model reads the car's pose once per Unity physics step and holds it across its
  own substeps, because Unity owns the integration and there is no correct pose to
  read in between. The harness re-reads every substep, so the two differ slightly at
  the same nominal rate. Mitigated by asking for a 0.005 s fixed timestep, which
  caps the lag at 5 ms. Worth re-measuring against the harness once Unity runs.
- The Unity scripts are checked against a hand-written `UnityEngine` stub, so a stub
  signature that differs from the real engine hides a compile error until first
  import. Known limit of the approach, not a defect in it.

**Driving a circuit**

- The plan is trusted with 0.85 of the grip the car measures on a skidpad, and not
  more. At 0.95 it spins on some circuits. Same cause as the understeer note above:
  the front saturates first, and past its peak slip angle more steering means less
  grip, so a fixed-line driver cannot recover what it did not anticipate. A driver
  that eased the throttle on rear slip angle would carry more, and that is a Phase 3
  decision rather than a physics one.
- The reference driver gives away 6 to 11% against its own plan bound. Most of that
  is corner exit, where it is still tracking a target speed rather than simply using
  the throttle it has.
- Peak sideslip reaches 18 degrees at Suzuka. The car gets round, but it is sliding
  more than a quick driver would allow.
- The ground under the lap runner is flat. Elevation is in the track files and is
  ignored, so nothing here says anything about Eau Rouge.

**Track pipeline**

- Lap estimates run 8 to 20% slow. Documented and expected, see `Tools/README.md`.
- Start line defaults to the longest straight, which is wrong for Spa. It lands on
  the Kemmel straight. Use `--start-offset-m` when Spa matters.
- Corners traced under 12 m radius are flagged but not widened. Hand work.
- Camber and banking ship as zero. No open dataset has them.
- Track width is uniform per circuit. Fields are per sample and ready to author.
- Exported track JSON uses `indent=1`, which puts every array element on its own
  line: 259,000 lines across the six circuits. They commit fine at 2.8 MB, but
  regenerating one circuit produces a 50,000 line diff. Worth a more compact
  writer before the set grows much. Noted 2026-09-22, not urgent.

## 7. Verification commands

Every DONE row is backed by one of these. Run them after any change.

```bash
# track pipeline: rebuilds all six circuits from cache, no network needed
Tools/.venv/bin/python Tools/verify_all.py
#   expect: "6 of 6 circuits pass", exit code 0

# vehicle physics: five checks against closed-form expectations
dotnet run --project Sim/CarRace.Harness -c Release
#   expect: "All 5 checks pass", exit code 0

# Unity integration layer: type-checks the scripts against a UnityEngine stub.
# Proves they compile and call the model correctly. Proves nothing about behaviour.
dotnet build Sim/CarRace.UnityCheck -c Release
#   expect: "0 Error(s)", exit code 0

# both halves together: the car drives every generated circuit, twelve laps in ~5 s
dotnet run --project Sim/CarRace.Harness -c Release -- --lap all
#   expect: "6 of 6 circuits completed on track", exit code 0

# diagnostics, when something is wrong
dotnet run --project Sim/CarRace.Harness -c Release -- --trace    # launch, skidpad
dotnet run --project Sim/CarRace.Harness -c Release -- --grip     # lateral force probe
dotnet run --project Sim/CarRace.Harness -c Release -- --corner   # steady cornering sweep

dotnet run --project Sim/CarRace.Harness -c Release -- --lap monza --verbose --csv lap.csv
```

## 8. Session log

Newest first. One entry per working session, recording what moved and what was
learned, so context is not lost between sessions.

### 2026-09-22

- Audited the machine. RAM, fast disk and VRAM together ruled out Unreal Engine 5.
  Settled on Unity 6 with HDRP, everything on D:.
- Built the track pipeline end to end. Six circuits, all within 0.17% of published
  length. Two findings worth keeping: a venue maps several layouts that share
  tarmac so loop selection must match published length, and the smoothing search
  must take the *least* smoothing that clears a spike floor, because maximising
  minimum radius erases real chicanes while no length check notices.
- Installed the .NET 8 SDK and built the vehicle physics as an engine-agnostic
  library plus a headless harness, so it could be validated before Unity existed.
  All five checks pass against closed-form expectations derived from the config.
- Eight bugs caught by that harness, listed in `Sim/README.md`. The largest was
  quaternion composition order in `System.Numerics`, which applied angular
  velocity in the body frame and pulled steady cornering apart after seconds.
- Replaced hand-picked validation targets with closed-form ones. The original 0 to
  100 target was below the car's own traction-limited floor and could never have
  been met.
- Initialised git and committed everything as `b3836af`. Before this, 40 files of
  work existed with no history and no backup.
- Added this file, and a rule in `CLAUDE.md` section 5 to keep it current during
  work rather than at the end.

### 2026-09-23, third session

- The physics drove a circuit the pipeline made, for the first time. `--lap all`:
  six circuits, twelve laps, about five seconds, all on track. Added
  `Sim/CarRace.Track` (track data, speed plan, path driver) and the harness side
  that loads the JSON and reports.
- It did not work at first, and guessing did not fix it. What fixed it was dumping
  per-step telemetry and reading it: the car was braking hard past turn-in, the rear
  axle unloaded exactly as it was asked for lateral grip, and it spun. The plan was
  letting it brake at full capability while already at the cornering limit, which no
  tyre can do.
- The obvious fix for that made it much worse, in a way that read as a slow car
  rather than a bad plan, and cost half a minute a lap. Taking lateral demand at the
  cornering-limit speed uses the whole ellipse by definition, so no braking is
  allowed through turn-in at all. The constraint has a closed form; use it.
- Measured rather than assumed: curvature across adjacent samples at 2 m spacing is
  30 to 50% noise on three of the six circuits. A stride of about 6 m reproduces the
  pipeline's own curvature with a correlation of 1.0000. Worth remembering that the
  pipeline had already solved this and the two only disagreed because I recomputed
  it without asking why theirs looked different.
- The lap times are honest but slow, because the plan only dares use 0.85 of the
  car's measured grip. That number is the understeer balance showing up again, and
  it is the most useful thing this run found.

### 2026-09-23, second session

- Wrote the Unity integration layer: `Bridge`, `CarDefinition`, `UnityGround`,
  `CarController`, `DriverInput`, `CarCamera`, with `Unity/README.md` covering the
  scene, the project settings and the copy step.
- Added `Sim/CarRace.UnityCheck`, which compiles those scripts against a
  signature-only `UnityEngine` stub. Verified the check works by breaking a call on
  purpose and watching it fail. It catches typos and wrong calls into the model; it
  runs nothing, and every method in the stub throws so it can never be mistaken for
  a behaviour test.
- Added `Drivetrain.Shift`. `AutomaticGearbox = false` was unusable from outside the
  model: `Gear` is a public field, and setting it swapped ratios with no shift time,
  so a manual upshift interrupted no drive at all and was worth free lap time.
- Talked myself out of one piece of superstition. Unity is described as left handed
  and `System.Numerics` as right handed, which suggests the quaternion conversion
  needs a sign flip. It does not: Unity defines its cross product by the left hand
  rule, so the component arithmetic is identical and a positive rotation about +Y
  takes +Z to +X in both. `Bridge.VerifyConventions` asserts that against the real
  engine at startup, because reasoning of that kind is worth nothing unchecked.
- Three traps in the integration are things that look like physics bugs and are not,
  so all three now report themselves: a ground mask that includes the car's own
  layer, a 50 Hz fixed timestep, and a torque curve out of rpm order.

### 2026-09-23

- Created a GitHub repo, `Yashuchirag/car-race`, pushed `main`, then made it
  public. Work now exists off the machine.
- Added licensing: MIT for the code, ODbL for `Tracks_Data/` since it is a Derived
  Database from OpenStreetMap. Found and fixed a real error doing so: the exporter
  stamped an OpenStreetMap attribution onto every file including the synthetic
  test circuit, which both encumbered original work with share-alike and credited
  OSM for something they had no part in. Attribution is now per source.
