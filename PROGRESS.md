# Progress

Live state of the project. Updated as work happens, not at the end, so that an
aborted session can be resumed instead of redone.

**Read section 1 first.** It says exactly where things stand and what the next
concrete action is. Everything below it is detail.

---

## 1. Resume here

**Last updated:** 2026-09-23 (repo public, licences added)

**Last completed:** Vehicle physics core, all five validation checks passing
against closed-form expectations.

**Next action:** Install Unity 6 LTS (manual, section 5), then write the Unity
integration layer listed in section 3, Phase 1.

**Nothing is half-finished right now.** Both test suites pass on a clean run:

```bash
Tools/.venv/bin/python Tools/verify_all.py          # expect: 6 of 6 circuits pass
dotnet run --project Sim/CarRace.Harness -c Release # expect: All 5 checks pass
```

If either fails on a fresh checkout, that is a regression and not something you
left unfinished.

## 2. Status key

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| DONE | Built and verified. A command in section 7 proves it. |
| WIP | Started. The row says exactly where it stopped and what comes next. |
| BLOCKED | Cannot proceed. The row says what is blocking it and who can clear it. |
| TODO | Not started. |

A row only becomes DONE when its verification command passes.

### Phase 2, track pipeline

**DONE.** Six circuits pass, all within 0.17% of published length. Detail in
`Tools/README.md`. Remaining polish is listed under section 6, not here, because
none of it blocks anything.

### Phases 3 to 6

TODO, all of them. Specified in IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md sections 10 to 13.
Nothing started, nothing to resume.

```

## 5. Blocked on you

1. **Install Unity 6 LTS.** Set the Hub's editor install location to D:. This is
   the only thing gating Phase 1 completion and everything after it.
2. **Add a Windows Defender exclusion** for the project folder and the Unity
   processes once it exists. Typically 2 to 5x on import times on a spinning disk.
3. **Push after meaningful work.** `git push` now that `origin` is configured. The
   repo is private; making it public later is a one-line change, the reverse is
   not really possible.

---

## 6. Open issues and deferred decisions

Known, deliberate, and not blocking. Recorded so they are not rediscovered.

**Vehicle physics**

- Car is understeer-biased: front slip angles reach 13 to 20 degrees at the limit
  while the rear sits at 3 to 5. That is why skidpad lands 15% under the tyre
  ceiling. Tuning, not a defect. Soften `AntiRollFront` or stiffen `AntiRollRear`.
- 0 to 100 is 11.6% above the perfect-launch analytic floor. Tyre relaxation and
  traction control catching the wheel account for it. Real launches lose time too.
- Tyre temperature and wear are not modelled. Phase 6 if wanted at all.
- Force feedback for a wheel needs a native plugin. Real uncertainty, Phase 6.

**Track pipeline**

- Lap estimates run 8 to 20% slow. Documented and expected, see `Tools/README.md`.
- Start line defaults to the longest straight, which is wrong for Spa. It lands on
  the Kemmel straight. Use `--start-offset-m` when Spa matters.
- Corners traced under 12 m radius are flagged but not widened. Hand work.
- Camber and banking ship as zero. No open dataset has them.
- Track width is uniform per circuit. Fields are per sample and ready to author.
- Exported track JSON uses `indent=1`, which puts every array element on its own
  line: 259,000 lines across the six circuits. They commit fine at 2.8 MB, but
  regenerating one circuit produces a 50,000 line diff. Worth a more compact
  writer before the set grows much. Noted 2026-09-22, not urgent.

---

## 7. Verification commands

Every DONE row is backed by one of these. Run them after any change.

```bash
# track pipeline: rebuilds all six circuits from cache, no network needed
Tools/.venv/bin/python Tools/verify_all.py
#   expect: "6 of 6 circuits pass", exit code 0

# vehicle physics: five checks against closed-form expectations
dotnet run --project Sim/CarRace.Harness -c Release
#   expect: "All 5 checks pass", exit code 0

# diagnostics, when something is wrong
dotnet run --project Sim/CarRace.Harness -c Release -- --trace    # launch, skidpad
dotnet run --project Sim/CarRace.Harness -c Release -- --grip     # lateral force probe
dotnet run --project Sim/CarRace.Harness -c Release -- --corner   # steady cornering sweep
Tools/.venv/bin/python Tools/build_track.py spa                   # one circuit, verbose
```

## 8. Session log

Newest first. One entry per working session, recording what moved and what was
learned, so context is not lost between sessions.

### 2026-09-22

- Audited the machine. RAM, fast disk and VRAM together ruled out Unreal Engine 5.
  Settled on Unity 6 with HDRP, everything on D:.
- Built the track pipeline end to end. Six circuits, all within 0.17% of published
  length. Two findings worth keeping: a venue maps several layouts that share
  tarmac so loop selection must match published length, and the smoothing search
  must take the *least* smoothing that clears a spike floor, because maximising
  minimum radius erases real chicanes while no length check notices.
- Installed the .NET 8 SDK and built the vehicle physics as an engine-agnostic
  library plus a headless harness, so it could be validated before Unity existed.
  All five checks pass against closed-form expectations derived from the config.
- Eight bugs caught by that harness, listed in `Sim/README.md`. The largest was
  quaternion composition order in `System.Numerics`, which applied angular
  velocity in the body frame and pulled steady cornering apart after seconds.
- Replaced hand-picked validation targets with closed-form ones. The original 0 to
  100 target was below the car's own traction-limited floor and could never have
  been met.
- Initialised git and committed everything as `b3836af`. Before this, 40 files of
  work existed with no history and no backup.
- Added this file, and a rule in `CLAUDE.md` section 5 to keep it current during
  work rather than at the end.

### 2026-09-23

- Created a GitHub repo, `Yashuchirag/car-race`, pushed `main`, then made it
  public. Work now exists off the machine.
- Added licensing: MIT for the code, ODbL for `Tracks_Data/` since it is a Derived
  Database from OpenStreetMap. Found and fixed a real error doing so: the exporter
  stamped an OpenStreetMap attribution onto every file including the synthetic
  test circuit, which both encumbered original work with share-alike and credited
  OSM for something they had no part in. Attribution is now per source.
